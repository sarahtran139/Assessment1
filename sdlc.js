// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design 
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements 
// Testing & Integration
// Planning 

/* ANSWER: 
Planing, Analysis of Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing & Integration, Maintain. 

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step. At this step, all the relevant information is collected from the customer to develop a product as per their expectation" 
const Design = " This is the third step,the requirement gathered in the SRS document is used as an input and software architecture that is used for implementing system development is derived "
const Implementation = "This is fourth step, implementation, starts once the developer gets the Design document. The Software design is translated into source code. All the components of the software are implemented "
const TestingandIntegration = "This is the fifth step Testing starts once the coding is complete and the modules are released for testing,testing is done until the point at which the software is as per the customers expectation "
const Maintain = "This is the last step, if any issue comes up and needs to be fixed or any enhancement is to be done is taken care by the developers."
